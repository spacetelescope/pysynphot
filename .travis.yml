install:
    # We now use the ci-helpers package to set up our testing environment.
    # This is done by using Miniconda and then using conda and pip to install
    # dependencies. Which dependencies are installed using conda and pip is
    # determined by the CONDA_DEPDENDENCIES and PIP_DEPENDENCIES variables,
    # which should be space-delimited lists of package names. See the README
    # in https://github.com/astropy/ci-helpers for information about the full
    # list of environment variables that can be used to customize your
    # environment. In some cases, ci-helpers may not offer enough flexibility
    # in how to install a package, in which case you can have additional
    # commands in the install: section below.

    - git clone git://github.com/astropy/ci-helpers.git
    - source ci-helpers/travis/setup_conda.sh

    # As described above, using ci-helpers, you should be able to set up an
    # environment with dependencies installed using conda and pip, but in some
    # cases this may not provide enough flexibility in how to install a
    # specific dependency (and it will not be able to install non-Python
    # dependencies). Therefore, you can also include commands below (as
    # well as at the start of the install section or in the before_install
    # section if they are needed before setting up conda) to install any
    # other dependencies.
